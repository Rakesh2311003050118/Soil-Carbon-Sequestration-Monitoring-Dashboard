## üìå Project 1: Soil Carbon Sequestration Monitoring Dashboard
### Overview
Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical component of soil health and plays a major role in mitigating climate change.  
This dashboard allows **real-time monitoring, visualization, and analysis** of SOC.

### üöÄ Features
- Input soil parameters (site, coordinates, depth, bulk density, % carbon).  
- Automatic SOC stock calculation:
- #SOC = Bulk Density √ó Depth √ó (Carbon% / 100  
- Real-time visualization with **Leaflet.js** (maps).  
- Charts and analytics with **Chart.js**.  
- Export results in **CSV & PDF**.  
- Session management & admin logs.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Database:** MySQL (via HeidiSQL)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js, Chart.js  
- **Reporting:** ReportLab Toolkit

## üìå Project 2: Role of AI in Cryptocurrency & SOC Monitoring
### Overview
This research explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be applied in two domains:
1. **Cryptocurrency** ‚Äì AI-driven prediction, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading.  
2. **Soil Carbon Sequestration** ‚Äì AI-augmented dashboard for SOC prediction using **machine learning models, IoT sensors, and satellite data**.  

### üî¨ Key Points
- **AI for SOC Prediction**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, Neural Networks) to forecast SOC based on soil, climate, and land-use data.  
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time soil sensor data (moisture, pH, temperature).  
- **Satellite Data Synchronization**: Remote sensing (NASA SMAP, Copernicus Sentinel) for global SOC tracking.  
- **AI in Cryptocurrency**: Identifying market trends, optimizing trades, and enhancing security.
